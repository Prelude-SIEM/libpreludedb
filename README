LibpreludeDB README
===================

OK, mostly for developers, quick and dirty ;-)

The conceptual diagram of the library is at
http://mops.uci.agh.edu.pl/~kzaraska/stuff/libpreludedb1.dia
you'll need to zoom to read everything :-/

The current functionality reflects what prelude-manager currently does,
i.e. it writes IDMEF messages to the database using current database
scheme (called 'Classic' in the library ;-)).

You need following modules:
- libpreludedb
- libprelude, use cvs co -r db-work libprelude
- prelude-manager, use cvs co -r db-work prelude-manager

Build order:
- libprelude
- libpreludedb
- prelude-manager

Before building libpreludeDB adjust database name, type, etc. in
libpreludedb/db-connections.c, function prelude_db_init_interfaces(),
because configuration is temporarily hard-coded there. 

Have fun...
