PreludeDB Library (https://www.prelude-siem.org)
PreludeDB is brought to you by CS-SI (http://www.c-s.fr).


PreludeDB Library Overview
========================

The PreludeDB Library provides an abstraction layer upon the type and the format
of the database used to store IDMEF alerts.
It allows developers to use the Prelude IDMEF database easily and efficiently without worrying about SQL,
and to access the database independently of the type/format of the database.

How to install the PreludeDB Library
==================================


If you don't want to build the PreludeDB Library yourself, some distributions include binary packages for prelude.

If you want to build PreludeDB, unpack the tarball and cd into the
newly created directory. Then type :

	./configure
	make

If everything works, su to root and type:

	make install
