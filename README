LibpreludeDB README
===================

OK, mostly for developers, quick and dirty ;-)

The conceptual diagram of the library is at
http://mops.uci.agh.edu.pl/~kzaraska/stuff/libpreludedb1.dia
you'll need to zoom to read everything :-/

The current functionality reflects what prelude-manager currently does,
i.e. it writes IDMEF messages to the database using current database
scheme (called 'Classic' in the library ;-)).

You need following modules:
- libpreludedb
- libprelude, use cvs co -r db-work libprelude
- prelude-manager, use cvs co -r db-work prelude-manager

Build order:
- libprelude
- libpreludedb
- prelude-manager

Interface specification passed to prelude_db_connect()
should be a C string of the following structure:

field1=value1 field2=value2, ...

If a value contains spaces or equal signs, it should be quoted using
single or double quotes. Additionally, single characters can be escaped
using backslash sign. 

Field names are case insetive. 
Currently used fields are:

* interface: name of the interface.

* class: interface class. REQUIRED. 
  Available values: 
  + sql

* type: database plugin type. REQUIRED. 
  Available values:
  + pgsql
  + mysql

* format: database format plugin. REQUIRED.
  Available values:
  + classic 

Following options are dependant on the used SQL plugin type. 

* host: host name of the SQL server. 

* port: port the server runs on. 

* name: database name.

* user: connect as user. 

* pass: password for the user. 

Have fun...
